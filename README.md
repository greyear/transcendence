### DATABASE CHOICE:
**PostgreSQL** was selected due to its strong support for relational data, transactions, and data consistency, which are critical for user management, permissions, and concurrent operations.
It also provides advanced indexing and full-text search capabilities while fitting well into a microservices architecture with strict data ownership and isolation.
Additionally, PostgreSQL is widely used in modern development, making it a practical choice for gaining relevant industry experience.
